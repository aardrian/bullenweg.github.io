### 2024-10-12

#### Matt forks and hijacks Advanced Custom Fields

As speculated, under the guise of "security", Matt forks WP Engine's Advanced Custom Fields plugin to "Secure Custom Fields" and hijacks the WordPress.org plugin page for Advanced Custom Fields to promote the fork.

> On behalf of the WordPress security team, I am announcing that we are invoking point 18 of the plugin directory guidelines and are forking Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) into a new plugin, Secure Custom Fields. SCF has been updated to remove commercial upsells and fix a security problem. ~[Secure Custom Fields on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/secure-custom-fields/)

Yesterday "Advanced Custom Fields by WP Engine". Today "[Secure Custom Fields by WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)".

### 2024-10-11

#### Rumors swirl that Matt plans to bring WP Engine-owned Advanced Custom Fields into WordPress Core

Following on from [poaching WPGraphQL from WP Engine](#acquires-wpgraphql-plugin) earlier in the week, Matt makes moves to take the open-source GPL-licensed version of Advanced Custom Fields and bring it in to WordPress Core.

> I have it from multiple trusted sources that the Matt surprise today will cross lines and break open source ethics. His villain era is truly here. ~[@kellie](https://x.com/kellie/status/1844837341267165447)

#### Matt uses @WordPress to retweet Automattic vs. WP Engine poll

Perhaps in a moment of clarity (or more likely in an effort to influence the results), [Matt uses @WordPress to retweet a poll](https://x.com/fireship_dev/status/1844742338175705570) showing community sentiment is firmly on the side of WP Engine.

<img width="600" alt="Which one is worse?" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c24347-1b79-41b9-9c74-92f2fc472fa9">

#### Matt's nose bleeds unacknowledged during podcast

Matt participates in a 30 minute podcast episode on World of DaaS with Auren Hoffman: [Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg: WordPress vs WP Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU3sd1kDFLg). At 20 minutes in, Matt's nose begins bleeding and Matt, without acknowledging the nose bleed, spends the rest of the interview with blood on his face.

### 2024-10-09

#### Suggests former employee is making a death threat

A former employee says:

> Has anyone tried turning @photomatt off and restarting him? ~[@kellie](https://x.com/kellie/status/1844007729284923901)

Matt responds:

> By “turning off” do you mean my life should end? ~[@photomatt](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1844153949198352622)

The next day:

> Thank you for clarifying. 🙏 I get a lot of actual death threats, so am pretty sensitive to it. ~[@photomatt](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1844344699496300711#m)

#### Automattic's "associate general counsel" Neil Peretz suggests Matt is out of control

On Hacker News, [Neil Peretz writes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41789765):

> Despite our sometimes fervent wishes, lawyers don't control clients. We are not puppeteers.

#### Bans WordPress contributors for questioning WP Engine affiliation ban

Matt bans long-term WordPress contributors for questioning his decision making in the WordPress Slack.

> For anybody who wants to understand why I've been banned from the #WordPress Slack. ~[@JavierCasares](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1843963052183433331.html)

> I was one of those banned this morning, along with Javier, from the Making WordPress Slack channel. I was also subsequently banned from wordpress.org. All seemingly for criticizing the checkbox decision. I'm a plugin developer with over 10 years of WP experience. One of my plugins is fairly well used in the community. I only say this to demonstrate the severity of what's happening. ~[/u/andrewfromatx](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fzucul/comment/lr4r4am/)

During the same conversation, Matt justifies the introduction of the WP Engine affiliation ban:

> I want you all to be informed and involved. Not to stay on the sidelines.

### 2024-10-08

#### Lies about lawyer statements

On [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41782365) Matt writes:

> Our lawyers have never said that WordPress.org is a non-profit or owned by the Foundation.

5 days prior in [WordPress Trademarks: A Legal Perspective](https://web.archive.org/web/20241009005430/https://automattic.com/2024/10/02/wordpress-trademarks-a-legal-perspective/), Neil Peretz the "associate general counsel at Automattic" said:

> The Foundation also licensed the name WordPress to the non-profit WordPress.org, which runs a website that facilitates access to WordPress-related software.

Later on October 8th, 5 days after the post was published, Matt updates the post to remove "non-profit" and Neil Peretz describes "non-profit" as a typo:

> I believe there was a typo in the post. If you read this thread you'll see a note below from Matt yesterday that the post was corrected. ~[neilperetz on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41794022)

#### Bans access to WordPress.org for anyone affiliated with WP Engine

To [log in to WordPress.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20241009053305/https://login.wordpress.org/) a user must certify that they have no association with WP Engine.

> I am not affiliated with WP Engine in any way, financially or otherwise.

#### Lies about what this is all about, again

Responding to [Automattic is doing open source dirty](https://world.hey.com/dhh/automattic-is-doing-open-source-dirty-b95cf128), Matt once again contradicts himself.

> Thank you for writing about this! I'm sorry if our messaging made you think this about the GPL — I have no issue with their use of GPL code. It's specifically about their misuse of the "WordPress" and "WooCommerce" trademarks.

See: [2024-09-28 Lies about motivation for dispute with WP Engine](#lies-about-motivation-for-dispute-with-wp-engine).

### 2024-10-07

#### Acquires WPGraphQL plugin

[Matt hires Jason Bahl](https://www.wpgraphql.com/2024/10/07/wpgraphql-becomes-a-canonical-plugin-my-move-to-automattic), author of WP Engine-sponsored WPGraphQL, conditional upon WPGraphQL transitioning to the control of Matt.

> With that said, I’m excited to announce that after 3.5 wonderful years at WP Engine, I’ve accepted an offer with Automattic to continue my work on WPGraphQL as it transitions into becoming a canonical community plugin on WordPress.org.

Matt's weaponisation of corporate sponsored Open Source projects harms the Open Source ecosystem, flying in the face of his claimed focus on the greater good.

#### Tweets about GraphQL

> Everyone thinks WPE owns GraphQL but they don’t. ~[@photomatt on X](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1843058551058784635)

Obviously "everyone" does not think that WPE own GraphQL because GraphQL has nothing to do with WordPress.

### 2024-10-05 

#### Announces Advanced Custom Fields security vulnerability

In a [since deleted tweet](https://x.com/automattic/status/1842612123488473341) Automattic (Matt) violates responsible disclosure by announcing a vulnerability in WPEngine's ACF plugin.

> Automattic's security team has responsibly disclosed a vulnerability in @wp_acf to @wpengine. As is standard, they have 30 days to issue a fix before public disclosure. We have reserved this CVE for the issue: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9529

#### Refuses to leave former Automattic employee Slack channel

> @photomatt joins the chat and refuses to leave after being asked politely. A safe space for former automatticians. ~[@kellie on X](https://x.com/kellie/status/1842625951508701214)

### 2024-10-04

#### Misrepresents history in "[Automattic—WP Engine Term Sheet](https://automattic.com/2024/10/01/wpe-terms/)" blog post

> May 30: Automattic shares first term sheet with WP Engine via email.

The term sheet Automattic sent to WP Engine in May 2024 did not refer to the WordPress Trademark.

#### ~~Blocks Automattic employees from using Blind~~

> ~~Right now emails from Blind are forwarding to me~~. ~[@kellie on X](https://x.com/kellie/status/1842231237903282391)

> Blind is totally open for Automatticians to join again, has been for months. ~[@photomatt on X](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1843062466382831734)

#### Threatens former employee with legal action

> TL;DR: Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic, co-founder of WordPress, and single point of failure for WordPress.org is trying to bully me with legal threats over my commentary regarding his recent behavior.

["Nice Guy" Matt Mullenweg, CEO of WordPress.com Cries Foul and Threatens Me With Legal Action](https://medium.com/@kelliepeterson/nice-guy-matt-mullenweg-ceo-of-wordpress-com-cries-foul-and-threatens-me-with-legal-action-f116ac57d862)

### 2024-10-03

#### Removes WordPress.com from WordPress.org Hosting recommendations

[WordPress/wordpress.org@0327a510ab252f465db6beef0534319373ee13bc](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress.org/commit/0327a510ab252f465db6beef0534319373ee13bc)

Removes WordPress.com from the [Hosting page](https://wordpress.org/hosting/) then adds another Automattic owned WordPress host in its place, [Pressable](https://pressable.com), which is running a [switch away from WP Engine campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/20241004202134/https://pressable.com/wpe-contract-buyout/).

#### Posts "[Response to WP Engine’s Meritless Lawsuit](https://automattic.com/2024/10/03/meritless/)"

Matt appoints Neal Katyal and makes the following claim:

> Neal has been adverse to Quinn Emanuel a number of times, and won every case.

Per [Mike Julian on Twitter](https://x.com/mike_julian/status/1842760610393825723):

> we looked back ten years and found seven total cases. Mr. Katyal has lost three times, won twice.

### 2024-10-02

#### Lies about reason to own WordPress.org himself

> The Foundation is a 501c3, so if it ran http://WordPress.org we'd have to remove all commercial plugins and anything that could be seen as promoting a for-profit. Would you like that? ~[@photomatt on X](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1841399185649623074)

The WordPress Foundation has many for-profit subsidiaries.

### 2024-10-01

#### Misrepresents WordPress.org financing

Admits to owning WordPress.org himself and implies he finances it.

> Please propose an alternative! They need to be independently wealthy to subsidize W.org, which serves 30k requests a second at peak, and ideally command a for-profit entity that can contribute thousands of hours a week to WordPress. ~[@photomatt on X](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1840892990413553976)

Later admits Automattic finances WordPress.org.

> Automattic employs ~100 people that work full-time on WordPress.org. I can appoint them into positions on WordPress.org, if I think that's appropriate. ~[photomatt on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41726796)

### 2024-09-29

#### Appears on Theo - t3․gg's YouTube channel for [The WordPress Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUJgahHjAKU)

### 2024-09-28

#### Lies about motivation for dispute with WP Engine

> The problem isn't their use of WP, it's their use of the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks. ~[photomatt on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41678035)

Subsequently admits the trademark is not the problem and is being used as an angle to attack WP Engine.

> “The analogy I made is they got Al Capone for taxes,” Mullenweg says. “So, if a company was making half a billion dollars from WordPress and contributing back about $100,000 a year, yes, I would be trying to get them to contribute more.” WP Engine competes directly with the hosting services offered by Automattic and WordPress.com, and Mullenweg argues one of the reasons for its success is the use of “WordPress” across its site. “That’s why we’re using that legal avenue to really, yeah, pressure them. That’s true: we are pressuring them.” ~[The Verge "Matt Mullenweg: ‘WordPress.org just belongs to me’"](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine)

### 2024-09-26

#### Appears on ThePrimeagen's Livestream

[![Matt Talks About WordPress Situation](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H6F0PgMcKWM/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6F0PgMcKWM)

### 2024-09-25

#### Publishes "[WP Engine is banned from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine-banned/)"

> What I will tell you is that, pending their legal claims and litigation against WordPress.org, WP Engine no longer has free access to WordPress.org’s resources.

WP Engine did not make any legal claims against WordPress.org, they issued a cease and desist to Automattic ([Automattic’s Actionable Misconduct Directed to WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf)).

#### Publishes "[Charitable Contributions](https://ma.tt/2024/09/charitable-contributions/)" on ma.tt

> I have kept my personal philanthropy private until now.

Matt has published information about his personal philanthropy many times.

### 2024-09-24

#### Modifies WordPress Trademark Policy

Matt modifies the [WordPress trademark policy](https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/) to add:

> The abbreviation “WP” is not covered by the WordPress trademarks, but please don’t use it in a way that confuses people. For example, many people think WP Engine is “WordPress Engine” and officially associated with WordPress, which it’s not. They have never once even donated to the WordPress Foundation, despite making billions of revenue on top of WordPress.
> 
> If you would like to use the WordPress trademark commercially, please contact Automattic, they have the exclusive license. Their only sub-licensee is Newfold.

### 2024-09-21

#### Publishes "[WP Engine is not WordPress](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/)"

> It has to be said and repeated: WP Engine is not WordPress. My own mother was confused and thought WP Engine was an official thing.

WordPress.org itself acknowledges the same confusion exists with WordPress.com.

> People are often confused about the differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org because they sure sound similar. This workshop highlights the key differences between .Org and .Com. Watch this short video to answer any questions you have. ~[What is the difference between WordPress .Com and .Org?](https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/what-is-the-difference-between-wordpress-org-and-com/)

Matt goes on to say:

> WordPress is a content management system, and the content is sacred. Every change you make to every page, every post, is tracked in a revision system, just like the Wikipedia.
> ...
> **WP Engine turns this off**. They disable revisions because it costs them more money to store the history of the changes in the database, and they don’t want to spend that to protect your content.

WP Engine responds in [Automattic’s Actionable Misconduct Directed to WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf).

> What WP Engine gives you is not WordPress, it’s something that they’ve chopped up, hacked, butchered to look like WordPress, but actually they’re giving you a cheap knock-off and charging you more for it.
> 
> The post falsely states, “What WP Engine gives you is not WordPress, it’s something that they’ve chopped up, hacked, butchered to look like WordPress, but actually they’re giving you a cheap knock-off and charging you more for it.” In truth, WP Engine’s WordPress installations are identical to the WordPress.org ZIP file which defines WordPress.  ~[Automattic’s Actionable Misconduct Directed to WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf)

Automattic themselves disable a wide variety of features in their paid products, like WordPress.com, Pressable and JetPack.

### 2024-09-17

#### Posts "[WordCamp US & Ecosystem Thinking](https://ma.tt/2024/09/ecosystem-thinking/)"

> Compare the Five For the Future pages from Automattic and WP Engine, two companies that are roughly the same size with revenue in the ballpark of half a billion.

Matt implies Five For the Future is the only way to contribute to the WordPress ecosystem. Five For the Future counts direct contributions to the Matt-owned WordPress project, not the wider ecosystem. WP Engine contribute [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/), sponsor [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) and develop [Local](https://localwp.com/) and [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

### 2010-09-13

#### Community blog wordpress™ wank publishes prescient post warning Matt's behaviour

14 years ago, [wordpress™ wank](https://wank.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/back-into-the-shade/) publishes [back into the shade](https://wank.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/back-into-the-shade/):

> How do we know that the ‘foundation’ isn’t going to use trademark violation as a weapon in the GPL jihad, using it as an excuse to shut down anyone promoting non-GPL code or documentation? We had a reasonable expectation that Automattic wouldn’t do that because they’re an actual legitimate business, with a board of directors and all that jazz, and the money men might have a shot at keeping Matt’s weirder impulses in check, but now nobody else gets a say in how the trademark’s used or how abuses (real or imagined) are handled. And somehow this gets spun as a great day for open source. Awesome.
